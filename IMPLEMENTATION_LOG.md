## Phase 1: Project Structure & Basic X11 Screen Capture ✅ COMPLETED

**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Git Commits:** 
- `767bc6e` - Add gitignore
- `600e27b` - Phase 1: Implement basic X11 screen capture functionality

### Implemented Features:

#### 1. Project Structure
- ✅ Created complete directory layout with `utils/` package
- ✅ Added `__init__.py` files for proper Python packaging
- ✅ Set up `.gitignore` for Python development
- ✅ Configured virtual environment with dependencies

#### 2. Core Screen Capture (`utils/capture.py`)
- ✅ Full screen capture using python-xlib
- ✅ Area-based capture with coordinates (x, y, width, height)
- ✅ Multi-monitor support via RandR extension with fallback
- ✅ Cursor inclusion with simple arrow drawing overlay
- ✅ PNG file saving with optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### 3. File Operations
- ✅ Timestamp-based naming: `Screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.png`
- ✅ Auto-creation of `~/Pictures/Screenshots/` directory
- ✅ Actual file size reporting
- ✅ Custom output directory support

#### 4. CLI Interface (`main.py`)
- ✅ `--screenshot` for full screen capture
- ✅ `--screenshot --area x,y,w,h` for area capture
- ✅ `--info` for system information display
- ✅ `--no-cursor` to exclude cursor from capture
- ✅ `--output PATH` for custom save location
- ✅ Comprehensive help and usage examples

### Technical Implementation:

**Dependencies Installed:**
- `python-xlib` - X11 screen capture and window access
- `Pillow` - Image processing and PNG optimization

**X11 Integration:**
- Direct X11 display access with proper cleanup
- RandR extension for multi-monitor geometry detection
- Raw image data conversion to PIL format (24-bit and 32-bit support)
- Cursor position querying and overlay drawing

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Full screen screenshots: 314.7 KB file created successfully
- ✅ Area-specific screenshots: 104.5 KB file created successfully  
- ✅ System info display: 1920x950 screen geometry detected
- ✅ Multi-monitor geometry detection working
- ✅ Proper file naming: `Screenshot_2025-09-29_12-04-38.png`
- ✅ Directory auto-creation verified
- ✅ CLI argument parsing and help display working

### Code Quality:
- Type hints implemented for all functions
- Comprehensive error handling with logging
- Clean separation of concerns (capture logic vs CLI)
- Proper resource cleanup for X11 connections
- PEP 8 compliant code structure

### Foundation for Next Phases:
- Core capture system ready for clipboard integration
- Modular design allows easy extension for UI overlay
- Screenshot functionality can be reused for video area selection
- CLI framework ready for daemon integration

---

## Phase 2: Clipboard Integration - PLANNED

### Goals:
- Add automatic clipboard copying for all screenshots
- Ensure cross-desktop compatibility
- Integrate with existing capture system

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create `utils/clipboard.py` module
- [ ] Implement image-to-clipboard functionality
- [ ] Test across different desktop environments
- [ ] Update CLI to always copy to clipboard
- [ ] Add clipboard error handling

---

## Phase 3: Window Detection - PLANNED

### Goals:
- Implement window detection for targeted capture
- Support clicking on windows for automatic geometry
- Handle different window managers

---

## Phase 4: Screenshot UI with Area Selection - PLANNED

### Goals:
- Create interactive overlay interface
- Implement drag selection with magnifier
- Add pixel-perfect selection tools

---

## Phase 5: Global Hotkey System & Daemon - PLANNED

### Goals:
- Background daemon with hotkey listening
- Configuration system for customizable hotkeys
- Process management for UI spawning

---

## Phase 6: FFmpeg Integration & Video Recording - PLANNED

### Goals:
- FFmpeg wrapper for video recording
- Audio capture integration
- Video area selection reusing screenshot UI

---

## Phase 7: Recording Control Panel & Area Indicators - PLANNED

### Goals:
- Floating control panel for recordings
- Visual recording area indicators
- Real-time file size monitoring

---

## Phase 8: Notifications & Polish - PLANNED

### Goals:
- Desktop notification integration
- UI polish and user experience improvements
- Comprehensive testing

---

## Phase 9: Documentation & Distribution - PLANNED

### Goals:
- Complete documentation
- PyInstaller packaging
- Installation scripts and system integration

---

## Development Notes:

### Architecture Decisions:
- Using python-xlib for direct X11 access (better performance than subprocess)
- PIL for image processing (mature, well-supported)
- Modular design with utils package for reusability
- CLI-first approach for testing before GUI implementation

### Performance Observations:
- Full screen capture (1920x950): ~315KB PNG files
- Area capture performance excellent for reasonable sizes
- X11 direct access provides fast capture times
- PNG optimization reduces file sizes significantly

### System Compatibility:
- Tested on X11 display :20 (VS Code dev container)
- 24-bit color depth working correctly
- RandR extension available and functional
- File system operations working across different directories
