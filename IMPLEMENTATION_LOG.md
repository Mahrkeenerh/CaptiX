    def get_visible_windows(self) -> List[WindowInfo]
    def _get_absolute_coordinates(self, window) -> Tuple[int, int]
```

**NEW: Pure Window Capture System:**
```python
class XComposite:
    def get_window_pixmap(self, window_id: int) -> Optional[Pixmap]
    def unredirect_window(self, window_id: int)

class ScreenCapture:
    def capture_window_pure_content(self, window_id: int) -> Optional[Image.Image]
    def capture_window_at_position_pure(self, x: int, y: int) -> Optional[Image.Image]

    def _capture_window_direct_with_info(self, window_info: WindowInfo) -> Optional[Image.Image]
```

**Coordinate System Resolution:**
- **Problem Solved:** X11 `translate_coords()` returning negative coordinates for decorated windows
- **Solution Implemented:** Custom hierarchy walking to accumulate coordinates from window to root
- **Result:** Accurate positive coordinates matching actual window positions on screen

**Pure Window Capture Innovation:**
- **XComposite Integration:** Uses XComposite extension for true off-screen buffer capture

- **Delivered:** Pure window content capture that guarantees no overlapping elements
- **Technical Achievement:** XComposite extension integration for off-screen buffer access
- **Practical Benefit:** Perfect window content capture for applications where overlaps are problematic

**Capture Method Comparison:**
- **Area Capture (`--area x,y,w,h`):** Captures screen content exactly as displayed
- **Window Capture (`--window-at x,y`):** Captures window region, may include overlapping elements  
- **Pure Window Capture (`--window-pure-at x,y`):** Captures window content without any overlapping elements

### Foundation for Next Phases:

- **Window capture proven** - Both traditional and pure methods work for video recording areas
- **CLI framework extended** - Ready for daemon integration and hotkey system

### Major Technical Achievement:
**Solved Multiple X11 Window Capture Challenges:**
1. **Root Cause:** Window manager decorations cause `translate_coords()` to return negative offsets
   - **Solution:** Implemented custom coordinate calculation via window hierarchy traversal
2. **Root Cause:** Traditional window capture includes overlapping elements
   - **Solution:** XComposite extension integration for pure window content capture
3. **Root Cause:** Window detection sometimes misses windows not in visible list
   - **Solution:** Direct window info approach bypassing visible window list limitations
4. **Impact:** Enabled both traditional and pure window capture functionality
5. **Benefit:** Foundation for professional-grade window-based features in CaptiX
