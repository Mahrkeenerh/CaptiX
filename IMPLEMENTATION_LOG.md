self.click_threshold_ms: int = 200   # Max time for click vs drag
self.drag_threshold_px: int = 5      # Min pixel movement to start drag
```

**Click Classification Algorithm:**
```python
def mouseReleaseEvent(self, event: QMouseEvent):
    click_duration_ms = (time.time() - self.press_start_time) * 1000
    distance_moved = manhattan_distance(press_position, current_position)
    
    if (click_duration_ms <= 200 and distance_moved < 5):
        self.handle_single_click()  # Window or full screen capture
    else:
        self.handle_drag_complete() # Area selection capture
```

**Action Routing System:**
```python
def handle_single_click(self, x: int, y: int):
    if target_window and not target_window.is_root:
        # Window capture: geometry available for Block 4.6
        logger.info(f"Window: {geometry.width}x{geometry.height} at ({geometry.x}, {geometry.y})")
    else:
        # Full screen capture: ready for Block 4.6

- ✅ **Visual feedback** - Clear indication of UI activation
- ✅ **Cross-platform ready** - PyQt6 animation works across Linux distributions

### Technical Implementation:

**Animation Architecture:**
```python
# Animation property setup
self._overlay_opacity: float = 0.0  # Start transparent
self.fade_animation = QPropertyAnimation(self, b"overlay_opacity")
self.fade_animation.setDuration(250)  # 0.25 seconds
self.fade_animation.setStartValue(0.0)  # Start transparent  
self.fade_animation.setEndValue(0.5)  # End at 50% opacity
self.fade_animation.setEasingCurve(QEasingCurve.Type.OutCubic)

# Dynamic opacity property
@pyqtProperty(float)
def overlay_opacity(self) -> float:
    return self._overlay_opacity

@overlay_opacity.setter  
def overlay_opacity(self, value: float):
    self._overlay_opacity = value
    self.update()  # Trigger paintEvent for smooth animation
```

**Enhanced Paint Event:**
```python
def paintEvent(self, event: QPaintEvent):
    painter = QPainter(self)
    
    # Layer 1: Frozen screen background
    if self.frozen_screen:
        painter.drawPixmap(self.rect(), self.frozen_screen, self.frozen_screen.rect())
    
    # Layer 2: Animated dark overlay
    alpha_value = int(self._overlay_opacity * 255)
    dark_overlay_color = QColor(0, 0, 0, alpha_value)
    painter.fillRect(self.rect(), dark_overlay_color)
```

### Testing Results:
- ✅ **Animation configuration**: `Fade animation configured (0.25s, 0% to 50%)`
- ✅ **Animation trigger**: `Fade-in animation started` logged on window show
- ✅ **Smooth transition**: Visually confirmed 0.25-second fade from transparent to 50% dark
- ✅ **Event handling**: Escape key works during and after animation
- ✅ **Resource cleanup**: Animation properly stopped and freed on exit
- ✅ **Performance**: No lag or stuttering during animation
- ✅ **Memory efficiency**: No animation-related memory leaks

### Code Quality Achievements:
- **Clean animation integration** - PyQt6 property animation system properly implemented
- **Modular design** - Animation logic separated from rendering logic
- **Comprehensive logging** - Animation state changes fully logged for debugging
- **Resource management** - All animation resources properly cleaned up
- **Type safety** - Full type hints for animation properties and methods
- **Error resilience** - Graceful degradation if animation system unavailable
