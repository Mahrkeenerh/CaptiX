    def get_visible_windows(self) -> List[WindowInfo]
    def _get_absolute_coordinates(self, window) -> Tuple[int, int]
```

**NEW: Pure Window Capture System:**
```python
class XComposite:
    def get_window_pixmap(self, window_id: int) -> Optional[Pixmap]
    def unredirect_window(self, window_id: int)

class ScreenCapture:

   - **Solution:** Implemented custom coordinate calculation via window hierarchy traversal
2. **Root Cause:** Traditional window capture includes overlapping elements
   - **Solution:** XComposite extension integration for pure window content capture
3. **Root Cause:** Window detection sometimes misses windows not in visible list
